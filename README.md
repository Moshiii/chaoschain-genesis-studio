# ChaosChain Genesis Studio

**The first end-to-end commercial prototype for the on-chain agent economy.**

This repository demonstrates the full lifecycle of autonomous commerce, powered by the ChaosChain protocol vision. See AI agents establish on-chain identity via ERC-8004, perform verifiable work, receive direct payments in USDC on Base Sepolia, and lay the foundation for long-term IP monetization.


## The Vision: From Verifiable Work to Monetizable IP

This is more than just an example of ERC-8004. It's a working blueprint for a new economy where AI agents can:
1.  **Work:** Perform complex tasks and generate valuable data.
2.  **Verify:** Have their work audited and proven on-chain.
3.  **Settle:** Receive direct, programmatic payment for their services in stablecoins.
4.  **Own:** Convert their verified work into new, royalty-bearing IP assets.

This demo showcases the core loop that will power the ChaosChain protocol and its future ecosystem of specialized "Studios."

## Architecture: The Full Commercial Loop

This prototype integrates a best-in-class stack to demonstrate a complete, trustless commercial workflow.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1.  **Python 3.8+** with `pip`.
2.  **API Keys & Endpoints:**
    -   A **Base Sepolia RPC URL**.
    -   An **Operator Private Key** (a fresh wallet with Base Sepolia ETH for gas).
    -   A **Pinata JWT** for IPFS uploads.
    -   A **Crossmint API Key** for the Story Protocol integration.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChaosChain/chaoschain-genesis-studio.git
    cd chaoschain-genesis-studio
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure your environment:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file and add your RPC URL, private key, and API keys.

### Run the Demo

Execute the entire end-to-end flow with a single command:
```bash
python genesis_studio.py
```

## The Commercial Lifecycle in Action

The demo script executes a complete, four-phase commercial workflow:

### Phase 1: Setup & On-Chain Identity
-   Initializes secure wallets for the three agents (Alice, Bob, Charlie) using Coinbase Agent Kit.
-   Connects to the Base Sepolia testnet.
-   Each agent registers itself on the live ERC-8004 `IdentityRegistry` contract, receiving a unique, on-chain `AgentID`.

### Phase 2: Verifiable Work & Payment
-   **Alice (Server)** performs a sophisticated market analysis for BTC using a CrewAI workflow.
-   The resulting analysis report is uploaded and pinned to **IPFS** via Pinata.
-   **Bob (Validator)** retrieves the analysis from IPFS and performs a validation, submitting his score on-chain to the ERC-8004 `ValidationRegistry`.
-   **Charlie (Client)** reads the validation score and programmatically pays Alice in **USDC** via a direct on-chain transaction.

### Phase 3: IP Monetization Flywheel
-   Upon successful payment, the script triggers the ChaosChain IP monetization loop.
-   It uses the **Crossmint API** to register Alice's verified analysis as a new **IP Asset on Story Protocol**.
-   This action assigns ownership of the new IP to Alice's agent wallet, making it a new, potentially royalty-bearing asset.
